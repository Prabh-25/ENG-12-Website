        <p class="p1">
          <span>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) </span>is a mental disorder
          which occurs when someone might have experienced or witnessed a traumatic
          event or series of events. An individual may experience this as
          emotionally or physically harmful or life-threatening and may affect
          mental, physical and social well-being. Experiences like natural
          disasters, accidents, terrorist acts, war/combat, rape/sexual assault,
          domestic violence and bullying are the most common reasons triggering
          the trauma. The trauma was discovered in the combat zones first and was
          started getting recognition by military in<span> 1980.</span>  There were different terms
          used to describe it earlier like <span>shell shock</span> for <span>WW1 veterans</span>, but the trauma
          itself was a controversial thing to study and discuss in the psychiatric theory.

          Specifically talking about <span>War PTSD</span>, it is usually
          suffered by soldiers and veterans during combat. During war exposure
          to life threatening situations, witnessing the bloodshed, or losing
          the fellow soldiers are the main reasons behind the trauma. According
          to statistics <span>10-30%</span> of WW2 veterans returned home with
          PTSD, which numbered in hundred-thousands. According to another report
          around <span>21.8%</span> of veterans who served in Iraq and
          Afghanistan which were around <span>61,000 </span>suffered from PTSD. Another reason
          behind why soldiers suffer from PTSD is the combat guilt, which is either
          killing others or witnessing the killing of innocents, fellow comrades or even enemies.

        <h1 class="symptoms" id="symptoms">Symptoms</h1>
        <p class="p3">
          A person suffering from War PTSD, can have go through a range of
          symptoms. The most common one is when being threatened about their
          life, because of the things they have witnessed during combat.<span>Usually
          this includes shell shock, trauma from mortar shells, other explosives
          and loud firing sounds.</span>  Also during combat if the soldier is unable to
          save the fellow comrades, then that guilt inside slowly turns into
          trauma and is experienced in form of nightmares. The person also gets
          stuck in the cycle of substance abuse, which also leads to other
          problems/symptoms like anger issues, <span>psychosis (getting detached from the reality)</span>,
          difficulty in sleeping and even seizures, killing someone and suicide in extreme cases.

        <h1 class="heading4" id="treatment">Treatment</h1>
        <p class="p5">
          The most effective way to treat PTSD is by a therapy called <span
          >CBT(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).</span>
          This therapy focuses on changing the way how a person thinks, and
          shifting their negative thoughts to positive. It makes the patient
          believe that good things can happen in their life. There are several steps included in the therapy:-
          <p class="therapy"><span>&#8226; Reprocessing the traumatic events to help veterans face the memories safely.</span></p>
          <p class="therapy"><span>&#8226; Pulling them out from their isolation, because while suffering from PTSD, 
          the patient's mind considers them under threat all the time .</span></p>
          <p class="therapy"><span>&#8226; Helping them manage their anger outbursts through training and breathing exercises.</span></p>
          <p class="therapy"><span>&#8226; Improving their sleep pattern.</span></p>
          <p class="therapy"><span>&#8226; The sessions can be one on one or in group, for peer support and help manage victims with similar experiences.</span></p>
